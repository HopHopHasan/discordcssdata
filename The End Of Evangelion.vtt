00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:22.509
A New Century Evangelion
Theatrical Version

2
00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:04.745
Sections 2 and 3 of the East Wing
will close at 1800 hours.

3
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.552
All staff must vacate the area
by 1630.

4
00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:12.950
Misato and Ayanami scare me.

5
00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:18.093
Help me.
Help me, Asuka.

6
00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:26.031
Hey, wake up. Hey...

7
00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.333
wake up!

8
00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.642
Hey, hey...

9
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:37.240
Asuka... Asuka...
Asuka!

10
00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:44.516
Help me.

11
00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:47.026
Please help me.

12
00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:49.461
Help me.

13
00:02:50.198 --> 00:02:51.460
Help me.

14
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:54.393
Help me!

15
00:02:54.836 --> 00:02:58.795
Call me an idiot like you always do!

16
00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:00.797
Hey!

17
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.712
I'm so fucked up.

18
00:03:52.227 --> 00:03:55.094
All access to and from
Headquarters has been restricted?

19
00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:57.490
We're on First Level Alert.

20
00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.257
That doesn't make sense.
I thought Kaoru was the last Angel.

21
00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:04.234
He was.
All the Angels have been defeated.

22
00:04:04.372 --> 00:04:06.932
If we're all safe, what are we
doing on First Level Alert?

23
00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:10.043
What's going to happen to
NERV and the Evas?

24
00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:11.806
I wish Dr. Akagi was here.

25
00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:14.313
NERV will probably be disbanded.

26
00:04:14.983 --> 00:04:17.543
I don't know what they're
going to do with us.

27
00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:22.148
All we can do is wait for the
Instrumentality Project to commence.

28
00:04:26.428 --> 00:04:29.397
So mankind, a race of flawed
and incomplete separate entities,

29
00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:33.456
has reached the end of
its evolutionary potential.

30
00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:37.265
The Instrumentality Project
will manufacture the evolution...

31
00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:40.464
of man's separate entities
into a single consummate being.

32
00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:42.702
And the Committee won't use
NERV or Adam.

33
00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:44.278
They'll use the Evas.

34
00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.347
Just like Kaji said they would.

35
00:04:46.748 --> 00:04:48.613
The time is at hand.

36
00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.351
Without the Lance of Longinus,

37
00:04:51.453 --> 00:04:53.819
we cannot use Lilith
to complete the Project.

38
00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:57.686
Our only hope is to proceed
using Lilith's only true offspring,

39
00:04:57.792 --> 00:04:59.123
Eva Unit 01.

40
00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:01.852
That was not part of
SEELE's original plan.

41
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.991
Creating the Evangelion was the
pinnacle of mankind's existence.

42
00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:09.493
Humanity must evolve and
shape this brave new world.

43
00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:12.099
That was why we created
the Eva Series.

44
00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:14.366
We need not cast aside
our human form...

45
00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.103
to use Evangelion
as our own private Ark.

46
00:05:17.312 --> 00:05:22.614
It's merely part of the process
to free us all for rebirth.

47
00:05:22.884 --> 00:05:26.081
The fate of destruction
is also the joy of rebirth.

48
00:05:26.187 --> 00:05:28.655
Through the sacrament
of death, God, and humanity,

49
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.520
all living beings will be united
and reborn as one.

50
00:05:31.893 --> 00:05:33.952
Death creates nothing.

51
00:05:34.195 --> 00:05:36.720
You deserve death.

52
00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:42.261
Mankind exists because
it has the will to live.

53
00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:47.204
That is the will of she
who chose to remain in the Eva.

54
00:06:50.338 --> 00:06:54.536
So, that's what really happened
during Second lmpact.

55
00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:56.808
They're on to me!

56
00:07:00.448 --> 00:07:02.279
No, wait, something else.

57
00:07:04.018 --> 00:07:05.144
It's begun.

58
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:09.219
We are under attack.

59
00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:12.259
Transfer the left to the emergency
communications systems!

60
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.987
Use satellite feed if you have to!

61
00:07:14.095 --> 00:07:15.926
Correct.
What's the right side status?

62
00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:19.428
Negative. All outgoing network lines
are being systematically cut off!

63
00:07:20.702 --> 00:07:22.226
They're going after the MAGI.

64
00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:24.832
Data upload from
external terminals.

65
00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:27.570
They're trying to hack
into the MAGI, sir!

66
00:07:27.675 --> 00:07:28.801
Just as I thought.

67
00:07:28.943 --> 00:07:31.002
Is it coming from the
MAGI 2 in Matsushiro?

68
00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:33.306
No, there are 5 MAGI systems
working together.

69
00:07:33.414 --> 00:07:36.315
So far I've identified the MAGI
from Germany, China, and the U.S.

70
00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:38.942
SEELE is pooling all its resources.

71
00:07:39.253 --> 00:07:42.586
Five MAGI against one.
Not good odds.

72
00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:45.121
The fourth firewall
has been breached!

73
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.451
Locking the main database...

74
00:07:47.595 --> 00:07:49.563
Negative!
The system is being overtaken!

75
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:53.167
They've breached the next level!
The backup system is inoperative!

76
00:07:53.868 --> 00:07:55.233
This is bad.

77
00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:59.170
If they capture the MAGI, they will
be able to occupy headquarters.

78
00:08:08.816 --> 00:08:10.340
Let me guess.

79
00:08:10.451 --> 00:08:12.942
They need help with the
MAGI's self-defense system.

80
00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:14.954
Yes. Report to the
Second Command Center...

81
00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:17.387
where you will be briefed
by Lt. Ibuki.

82
00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:21.050
He expects the woman
he abandoned to jump when he calls.

83
00:08:21.162 --> 00:08:23.255
Arrogant bastard.

84
00:08:23.798 --> 00:08:26.266
A Level 2 Alert is in effect.

85
00:08:26.567 --> 00:08:27.659
Status report.

86
00:08:27.969 --> 00:08:32.235
Good morning. Tokyo 2
launched Special Order A-801.

87
00:08:32.573 --> 00:08:33.597
801?

88
00:08:33.708 --> 00:08:36.370
NERV's legal protection and
jurisdiction have been rescinded...

89
00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:39.412
and command has been transferred
to the Japanese Government.

90
00:08:41.082 --> 00:08:44.210
That was the only warning.
They tried to take the MAGI,

91
00:08:44.352 --> 00:08:47.549
but we've managed to
contain the damage so far.

92
00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:49.223
Ibuki here.

93
00:08:49.323 --> 00:08:53.089
Dr. Akagi is currently installing
additional defense programs.

94
00:08:55.997 --> 00:08:57.624
Ritsuko?!

95
00:09:07.008 --> 00:09:09.442
Am I doing something stupid?

96
00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:14.008
The interaction between
men and women is so illogical.

97
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.950
Isn't that right...

98
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.251
Mother?

99
00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:24.490
Goura Ground circuit recovery 0.2%.

100
00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:25.718
How much longer?

101
00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:29.263
We should make it.
Dr. Akagi is amazing!

102
00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:32.229
Just hacking into the MAGI?
Yeah, right.

103
00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:35.393
I doubt they're going
to let us off that easily.

104
00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:37.331
The MAGI was just foreplay.

105
00:09:37.438 --> 00:09:40.532
They plan to launch an all-out
offensive against Headquarters...

106
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:43.109
and take the two Evas by force,
don't they?

107
00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:47.570
Of course.
We have both Adam and Lilith.

108
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.615
No wonder the old men
are so nervous.

109
00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:56.413
External feed to the MAGI
has been halted.

110
00:09:56.924 --> 00:09:58.824
A Danang B-Type
Defense program is in place.

111
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.722
External access has been
cut off for the next 62 hours.

112
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.235
Mother.
I'll see you soon.

113
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:16.139
Ikari has installed a Type 666 firewall
on the MAGI's external feed circuits.

114
00:10:16.277 --> 00:10:18.370
That's very difficult to breach.

115
00:10:18.479 --> 00:10:21.846
Apparently we will have to forgo
acquisition of the Tokyo-3 MAGI.

116
00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:26.678
I had hoped to settle this peacefully.

117
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:29.788
Launch the invasion forces
immediately!

118
00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:41.692
All units move out as planned.

119
00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:13.827
We have lost the radar feed
from sectors 8-17!

120
00:11:13.935 --> 00:11:15.766
A large detachment of
Special Force Units...

121
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.599
has invaded the outer
defense perimeter!

122
00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:20.196
Two more are approaching
from the Gotenba sector!

123
00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:24.475
After all we've been through,
our final enemy is our fellow man.

124
00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:27.407
All personnel go to
Level One battle stations.

125
00:11:27.515 --> 00:11:29.540
Battle stations?!

126
00:11:30.084 --> 00:11:33.520
But they're human, not Angels!

127
00:11:33.988 --> 00:11:35.853
I wish they felt the same way.

128
00:12:00.081 --> 00:12:01.673
What's happening?!
Hey!

129
00:12:01.782 --> 00:12:02.806
What's wrong?

130
00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:05.147
Transmission from
the southern hub has been...

131
00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:18.426
The Daigatake tunnel
has been cut off!

132
00:12:18.532 --> 00:12:20.466
Fire in the West No.5 entrance!

133
00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:23.036
Hostile forces have entered Level 1!

134
00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:25.435
The west side attack is a decoy!

135
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.673
If they're really after the Evas,
they'll go after the pilots first.

136
00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:31.936
- Tell Shinji to stand by in Unit 01.
- Roger!

137
00:12:32.046 --> 00:12:34.014
- Where's Asuka?
- Still in recovery room 303.

138
00:12:35.349 --> 00:12:37.249
Get her into Unit 02!

139
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:40.614
There's no way she can
synchronize with Unit 02!

140
00:12:41.022 --> 00:12:43.320
If they find her,
they're going to kill her.

141
00:12:43.457 --> 00:12:45.823
If we put her in Unit 02,
at least she'll be safe.

142
00:12:45.927 --> 00:12:47.292
Understood!

143
00:12:47.395 --> 00:12:51.126
As soon as Asuka's in there,
hide Unit 02 at the bottom of the lake.

144
00:12:51.232 --> 00:12:53.757
It's not the best hiding place,
but it's better than the cage.

145
00:12:53.868 --> 00:12:55.563
- Where's Rei?
- Unable to locate!

146
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.103
Pilot of Unit 00 is missing!

147
00:12:58.172 --> 00:13:00.470
She will be killed.
Find her, now!

148
00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:20.320
Launching Unit 02
via gate number 8.

149
00:13:20.428 --> 00:13:22.760
The Eva will remain underwater
at a depth of 70 meters.

150
00:13:22.863 --> 00:13:26.355
Prepare to deploy Unit 01.
Station it in the Geofront.

151
00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:28.935
We can't!
Shinji isn't there!

152
00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:32.836
Oh, dear god...

153
00:13:33.207 --> 00:13:35.971
Full lock down has been instigated,
starting at Level 2.

154
00:13:36.077 --> 00:13:39.638
All non-combat personnel must evacuate
via route 87 immediately. I repeat...

155
00:13:44.752 --> 00:13:46.879
The No.3 underground barricade
has been destroyed!

156
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:49.319
Enemy forces have begun
invading Level 2!

157
00:13:49.423 --> 00:13:51.891
There's nothing we can do
to hold them off.

158
00:13:51.993 --> 00:13:54.018
Our defeat has become inevitable.

159
00:13:55.663 --> 00:13:58.689
Professor Fuyutsuki,
please see to the rest of this for me.

160
00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:01.666
Yes, Commander.
Give my regards to Yui.

161
00:14:25.993 --> 00:14:27.654
No response from Level 2!

162
00:14:27.828 --> 00:14:30.023
Contact has been lost
with control room 77.

163
00:14:30.498 --> 00:14:33.058
Internal monorail track 57
has been destroyed.

164
00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:36.034
This is brutal!
I'd rather be fighting the Angels!

165
00:14:36.637 --> 00:14:40.573
Of course. We're not used
to fighting human enemies.

166
00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:52.712
Sever the red ones first.

167
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.996
Level 3 Block B has been invaded!
There's no stopping them!

168
00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:04.792
Enemy presence confirmed
in Block F!

169
00:15:04.932 --> 00:15:06.797
The Main bypass is under fire!

170
00:15:07.301 --> 00:15:10.395
Seal off levels 1-3!
Order a full retreat!

171
00:15:10.571 --> 00:15:14.439
Release Bakelite through all
passages up through section 803!

172
00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:15.600
Right!

173
00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:18.405
Commencing Bakelite release
in section 703,

174
00:15:18.546 --> 00:15:19.911
thirty seconds to completion.

175
00:15:20.448 --> 00:15:22.973
Commencing Bakelite release
in section 737...

176
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:25.851
Well, that should buy us some time.

177
00:15:25.953 --> 00:15:28.547
Major Katsuragi!
Route 47 is completely blocked.

178
00:15:28.689 --> 00:15:32.056
The third Unit is unable to advance.
Shinji is cut off!

179
00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:41.628
All non-combat personnel
should avoid engaging the enemy.

180
00:15:43.037 --> 00:15:44.334
These guys are pros,

181
00:15:44.505 --> 00:15:46.405
so if you can't retreat
to Central Dogma...

182
00:15:46.507 --> 00:15:48.805
you're better off just surrendering.

183
00:15:48.909 --> 00:15:51.400
- Take charge of things here for me.
- Right.

184
00:15:53.747 --> 00:15:55.339
Mt. Futagoyama has been secured.

185
00:15:55.449 --> 00:15:57.280
This is harder than we thought.

186
00:15:57.384 --> 00:15:59.852
We never get the easy jobs.

187
00:16:00.588 --> 00:16:06.288
This is insane! The center wasn't
made to withstand invading armies.

188
00:16:06.794 --> 00:16:08.625
We can barely hold off terrorists.

189
00:16:08.729 --> 00:16:12.859
If the JSSDF launches a
full-scale attack, we're screwed.

190
00:16:13.434 --> 00:16:16.562
Slowly but surely they've been
cutting our defense budget.

191
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.366
They've probably been planning this
since the very beginning.

192
00:16:19.473 --> 00:16:21.065
Very possible...

193
00:16:32.186 --> 00:16:33.380
Release the safety.

194
00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:38.354
I can't.
I just can't shoot this thing.

195
00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:40.689
Of course you can!
You've had basic training!

196
00:16:40.794 --> 00:16:43.729
But I shot at targets,
not at other human beings!

197
00:16:44.765 --> 00:16:46.790
Idiot!
It's kill or be killed!

198
00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:03.839
Rei.

199
00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:12.756
I knew I'd find you here.

200
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.192
The time has come.
Let's go.

201
00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:28.264
Level 1 has been secured. Over.

202
00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:31.867
Roger that. We are moving in on the
MAGI and the Level 2 Command Center.

203
00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:34.106
We are currently
engaged in combat.

204
00:17:34.215 --> 00:17:38.208
Commence cooling of the Fifth
Malbolgia sector immediately.

205
00:17:42.823 --> 00:17:44.620
Terminate Eva Pilots on sight.

206
00:17:44.725 --> 00:17:47.353
Execution of non-combat personnel
has been authorized.

207
00:17:47.461 --> 00:17:50.453
Yanagihara and Shinjo units,
proceed to lower level.

208
00:17:56.036 --> 00:17:58.368
We've located the Third Child.
Commencing termination.

209
00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:03.540
Sorry, kid. Nothing personal.

210
00:18:12.052 --> 00:18:14.043
Nothing personal here either.

211
00:18:18.025 --> 00:18:21.222
Let's get you to Unit 01.
Come on.

212
00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:27.691
Roger that.
We have the purple unit surrounded.

213
00:18:27.801 --> 00:18:29.894
The Bakelite infusion
was not a problem.

214
00:18:33.907 --> 00:18:39.470
Damn. They're trying to prevent
contact between Shinji and Unit 01.

215
00:18:39.713 --> 00:18:41.840
We're running out of time.

216
00:18:42.016 --> 00:18:44.007
This is it, Shinji.

217
00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:50.690
Do you want to run away
or do you want to pilot the Eva?

218
00:18:51.325 --> 00:18:53.691
If you sit there and do nothing,
then you're already dead!

219
00:18:54.228 --> 00:18:56.628
Help me, Asuka... help me.

220
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:01.094
Hiding behind the skirts of
a little girl at a time like this?!

221
00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:04.329
Giving up halfway is worse
than never trying at all!

222
00:19:04.905 --> 00:19:06.600
Get up.

223
00:19:07.808 --> 00:19:08.934
Move it!

224
00:19:09.677 --> 00:19:13.613
I want to die.
I don't want to do anything.

225
00:19:13.914 --> 00:19:15.905
Stop talking like a
stubborn little brat!

226
00:19:16.016 --> 00:19:18.075
Like it or not, you're still alive!

227
00:19:18.185 --> 00:19:21.279
Get moving and DO something!
You can die later.

228
00:19:24.858 --> 00:19:25.847
Unimportant!

229
00:19:25.993 --> 00:19:28.928
Securing Terminal Dogma is
your top priority, understand?!

230
00:19:33.634 --> 00:19:35.033
They've destroyed everything else,

231
00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:37.103
why don't they just nuke us
and get it over with?!

232
00:19:37.204 --> 00:19:40.469
If we weren't sitting on top of
the original MAGI system,

233
00:19:40.574 --> 00:19:41.973
they probably would have.

234
00:19:42.643 --> 00:19:45.168
They probably need it in
as intact as they can get it.

235
00:19:45.346 --> 00:19:47.610
I just hope they don't use
BC weapons.

236
00:19:47.715 --> 00:19:49.239
Things could get pretty ugly.

237
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.817
That or N2 mines.

238
00:20:14.241 --> 00:20:15.503
Speak of the devil...

239
00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:17.600
They aren't holding anything back!

240
00:20:17.711 --> 00:20:19.406
They're over doing it.

241
00:20:26.053 --> 00:20:28.715
Why do they want
the Eva this badly?!

242
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.888
They plan to initiate Third lmpact...

243
00:20:32.025 --> 00:20:34.220
using the Eva series
instead of the Angels.

244
00:20:35.362 --> 00:20:39.458
15 years ago, the Second lmpact was
intentionally engineered by mankind,

245
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.233
because it was the only way
to minimize the potential damage.

246
00:20:43.537 --> 00:20:46.370
They had to reduce Adam
to an embryonic state...

247
00:20:46.507 --> 00:20:49.101
before the other Angels awoke.

248
00:20:50.444 --> 00:20:55.313
You see, Shinji, mankind was
spawned from a being called Lilith,

249
00:20:55.416 --> 00:20:58.351
just like Adam was.

250
00:20:58.719 --> 00:21:00.914
We are the 18th Angel.

251
00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:03.815
The other Angels are just
different possibilities of...

252
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:06.218
what we could have become.

253
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.729
Sadly, we can't coexist...

254
00:21:09.863 --> 00:21:13.299
even though we are fundamentally
the same creatures.

255
00:21:14.468 --> 00:21:18.427
Listen, Shinji. You have to destroy
the rest of the Eva Series.

256
00:21:18.939 --> 00:21:21.407
It's the only way to stay alive.

257
00:21:22.609 --> 00:21:24.770
The phone lines are all dead.

258
00:21:24.878 --> 00:21:27.848
Nagano Prefecture, Neo Tokyo 2

259
00:21:25.746 --> 00:21:27.848
Yes, sir. Missile impact was

260
00:21:27.848 --> 00:21:31.051
Prime Minister's Official Residence
Executive Office Number 3

261
00:21:27.965 --> 00:21:29.715
confirmed three minutes ago.

262
00:21:29.725 --> 00:21:31.051
This Instrumentality Project

263
00:21:31.051 --> 00:21:34.111
NERV was secretly researching...

264
00:21:34.221 --> 00:21:38.920
trying to initiate Third lmpact
and destroy all of mankind.

265
00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:40.820
The whole thing makes me sick.

266
00:21:41.061 --> 00:21:43.359
Humanity is probably
the only creature...

267
00:21:43.497 --> 00:21:45.488
capable of hating its own kind.

268
00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:48.067
Well, then. I suppose
all we have left to do...

269
00:21:48.168 --> 00:21:50.159
is destroy NERV Headquarters.

270
00:21:50.304 --> 00:21:53.034
Should Germany or China
begin re-development?

271
00:21:53.307 --> 00:21:55.468
No. We won't make
the same mistake twice.

272
00:21:55.609 --> 00:21:59.705
Make sure no one can touch it
for the next 20 years, like Old Tokyo.

273
00:22:02.716 --> 00:22:04.047
Surface heat has dissipated.

274
00:22:04.184 --> 00:22:06.778
High pressure steam discharges
have also stopped.

275
00:22:06.887 --> 00:22:08.980
All detachments' positions
have been confirmed.

276
00:22:09.523 --> 00:22:13.323
Dogma Level 3 and the
purple unit are currently secured.

277
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.754
And the red one?

278
00:22:15.062 --> 00:22:17.496
In the lake,
about 70 meters down.

279
00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:19.724
We don't know
if the pilot is alive or dead.

280
00:22:32.379 --> 00:22:33.937
I'm still alive...?

281
00:22:52.515 --> 00:22:54.465
I don't want to die.

282
00:22:54.565 --> 00:22:56.515
I don't want to die.

283
00:22:56.615 --> 00:22:58.515
I don't want to die.

284
00:22:58.615 --> 00:23:00.515
I don't want to die.

285
00:23:00.615 --> 00:23:02.515
I don't want to die.

286
00:23:02.615 --> 00:23:04.465
I don't want to die.

287
00:23:04.565 --> 00:23:06.615
I don't want to die.

288
00:23:06.715 --> 00:23:08.715
I don't want to die.

289
00:23:08.815 --> 00:23:11.015
I don't want to die.

290
00:23:11.115 --> 00:23:12.915
I don't want to die.

291
00:23:13.015 --> 00:23:14.815
I don't want to die.

292
00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:16.815
I don't want to die.

293
00:23:16.915 --> 00:23:18.815
I don't want to die.

294
00:23:18.915 --> 00:23:21.215
I don't want to die.

295
00:23:20.585 --> 00:23:22.465
You're still alive...

296
00:23:21.315 --> 00:23:23.515
I don't want to die.

297
00:23:23.615 --> 00:23:25.865
I don't want to die.

298
00:23:23.895 --> 00:23:27.035
You mustn't die yet...

299
00:23:25.965 --> 00:23:27.855
I don't want to die.

300
00:23:27.665 --> 00:23:29.695
You must live...

301
00:23:27.955 --> 00:23:30.365
I don't want to die.

302
00:23:30.465 --> 00:23:32.515
I don't want to die.

303
00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:33.345
I won't let you die...

304
00:23:32.615 --> 00:23:34.615
I don't want to die.

305
00:23:33.535 --> 00:23:35.675
I will protect you...

306
00:23:34.715 --> 00:23:36.615
I don't want to die.

307
00:23:35.775 --> 00:23:38.975
You're still alive...

308
00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:38.815
I don't want to die.

309
00:23:38.915 --> 00:23:41.015
I don't want to die.

310
00:23:39.075 --> 00:23:41.605
I won't let you die...

311
00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:43.015
I don't want to die.

312
00:23:41.715 --> 00:23:45.125
You mustn't die...

313
00:23:43.115 --> 00:23:44.825
I don't want to die.

314
00:23:44.925 --> 00:23:46.615
I don't want to die.

315
00:23:45.215 --> 00:23:47.085
Please die with me!

316
00:23:46.715 --> 00:23:48.515
I don't want to die.

317
00:23:47.185 --> 00:23:48.625
Don't kill her...

318
00:23:48.615 --> 00:23:50.715
I don't want to die.

319
00:23:50.815 --> 00:23:52.515
I don't want to die.

320
00:23:52.615 --> 00:23:54.515
I don't want to die.

321
00:23:54.615 --> 00:23:56.115
I don't want to die.

322
00:23:56.215 --> 00:23:57.815
I don't want to die.

323
00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:58.765
You must live...

324
00:23:57.915 --> 00:23:59.805
I don't want to die.

325
00:23:59.905 --> 00:24:02.655
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!!!

326
00:24:07.874 --> 00:24:10.502
Mamma!
You've been here all along?

327
00:24:16.984 --> 00:24:17.973
Mamma!!

328
00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:27.624
- What is that?!
- Dear God!

329
00:24:57.958 --> 00:25:01.257
Mamma... Mamma!
Now I understand!

330
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.991
The meaning of the AT Field!

331
00:25:07.701 --> 00:25:09.328
You were always protecting me!

332
00:25:12.572 --> 00:25:14.130
Always watching over me!

333
00:25:29.556 --> 00:25:33.686
We were always together!
Mamma!

334
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.161
Eva Unit 02 has activated!
Asuka is okay! She's alive!

335
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.467
Asuka?!

336
00:25:45.405 --> 00:25:46.429
The cable!

337
00:25:46.673 --> 00:25:49.870
Focus your fire power on that cable!

338
00:25:54.648 --> 00:25:56.639
Even without my umbilical cable,

339
00:25:57.784 --> 00:26:00.719
I've still got 12 thousand plates
of fortified armor!

340
00:26:03.724 --> 00:26:05.885
And I've got my AT Field!

341
00:26:10.097 --> 00:26:12.224
There's no way I can lose!

342
00:26:14.935 --> 00:26:16.960
Not to you bastards!

343
00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:42.057
That loathsome Evangelion.

344
00:26:42.195 --> 00:26:44.993
Once again,
our plans will go unrealized.

345
00:26:45.298 --> 00:26:49.632
It seems we'll have to
fight fire with fire.

346
00:27:19.266 --> 00:27:20.756
The Eva Series?

347
00:27:20.867 --> 00:27:22.300
It's been completed?

348
00:27:29.843 --> 00:27:34.075
They've dispatched all 9 units
equipped with S2 engines?

349
00:27:34.181 --> 00:27:35.512
That seems a bit much.

350
00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:38.717
Unless...
do they plan to start it here?!

351
00:27:58.405 --> 00:28:02.205
Listen up, Asuka. I want you to
destroy the rest of the Eva series.

352
00:28:02.776 --> 00:28:04.573
Shinji will be there
as soon as he can.

353
00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:06.042
Hang in there.

354
00:28:06.313 --> 00:28:09.976
So, we can get to Unit 01
through Access route 20, right?

355
00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:12.517
Affirmative. We placed triple
protection on the power supply.

356
00:28:12.619 --> 00:28:14.610
So long as you get there
in the next three minutes,

357
00:28:14.721 --> 00:28:16.188
it'll take you directly to cage 7.

358
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:33.032
"Destroy the rest of the Eva Series, '
huh?

359
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.109
Is that any way to talk to someone
fresh out of the hospital?

360
00:28:38.578 --> 00:28:40.739
Nine units in only
three and a half minutes...

361
00:28:40.847 --> 00:28:43.247
so that's 20 seconds each.

362
00:29:03.837 --> 00:29:04.804
Erste!

363
00:29:13.046 --> 00:29:14.035
This is it.

364
00:29:22.622 --> 00:29:23.919
They got away.

365
00:29:24.024 --> 00:29:27.323
Target has not been terminated.
Should we pursue them?

366
00:29:27.427 --> 00:29:28.394
Negative.

367
00:29:28.495 --> 00:29:30.190
That area has been
targeted for demolition.

368
00:29:30.297 --> 00:29:31.264
Pull back immediately.

369
00:29:31.665 --> 00:29:32.632
Roger.

370
00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:38.537
Well, that should
hold them off for a while.

371
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:46.777
Don't worry.
It's not as bad as it looks.

372
00:29:53.086 --> 00:29:55.953
The power is still on.
There's still time.

373
00:30:02.095 --> 00:30:04.154
Shinji, listen to me.

374
00:30:04.264 --> 00:30:06.357
From now on,
you're on your own.

375
00:30:06.499 --> 00:30:09.400
You'll have to make
your own decisions.

376
00:30:11.104 --> 00:30:15.404
I... I can't. I'm no good.

377
00:30:16.076 --> 00:30:21.981
I can't pilot Eva if all I do
is hurt and kill people.

378
00:30:23.483 --> 00:30:26.884
I thought I had no choice
but to pilot Eva,

379
00:30:26.987 --> 00:30:28.955
but I was just lying to myself.

380
00:30:29.055 --> 00:30:32.616
I'm not worthy of piloting an Eva
because I don't understand anything!

381
00:30:32.726 --> 00:30:35.661
I'm incapable of doing
anything good for anyone else.

382
00:30:37.831 --> 00:30:39.924
I did something terrible to Asuka.

383
00:30:40.567 --> 00:30:42.558
I killed Kaoru.

384
00:30:42.902 --> 00:30:46.269
I'm a horrible person.
I'm dishonest and a coward.

385
00:30:46.373 --> 00:30:50.571
All I ever do is hurt other people,
so I'd rather do nothing at all!

386
00:30:51.244 --> 00:30:53.041
I'm not going to feel sorry for you.

387
00:30:53.179 --> 00:30:57.309
If you don't like feeling pain,
then you can just sit here and die.

388
00:30:58.351 --> 00:31:01.479
Crying isn't going to
solve anything, either!

389
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.023
You hate yourself, don't you?
That's why you hurt others.

390
00:31:07.127 --> 00:31:09.527
Deep down you know
that you suffer more...

391
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:14.191
when you cause someone else pain,
than if you just let yourself get hurt.

392
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.532
But, Shinji, that was YOUR decision,
so that makes it a valid choice.

393
00:31:18.705 --> 00:31:22.835
That was what you wanted,
so that makes it worthwhile.

394
00:31:23.076 --> 00:31:27.012
Stop lying to yourself, and
realize that you DO have options.

395
00:31:27.113 --> 00:31:29.911
Then accept the choices
you've made.

396
00:31:30.016 --> 00:31:32.746
But you're not me.

397
00:31:32.852 --> 00:31:35.013
You don't understand!

398
00:31:36.489 --> 00:31:38.480
So what if I'm not you?!

399
00:31:38.691 --> 00:31:42.855
That doesn't mean
it's okay for you to give up!

400
00:31:43.596 --> 00:31:47.965
If you do, I'll NEVER forgive you
as long as I live.

401
00:31:48.068 --> 00:31:50.127
I'm not perfect either.

402
00:31:50.403 --> 00:31:53.566
I've made tons of stupid mistakes
and later I regretted them.

403
00:31:53.706 --> 00:31:56.402
And I've done it
over and over again.

404
00:31:56.543 --> 00:31:59.478
A cycle of hollow joy
and vicious self-hatred.

405
00:31:59.612 --> 00:32:02.740
But even so, every time
I learned something about myself.

406
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:05.740
Please, Shinji.

407
00:32:06.019 --> 00:32:10.388
You've got to pilot Eva and
settle this once and for all.

408
00:32:11.257 --> 00:32:14.784
Find out why you came here.

409
00:32:14.894 --> 00:32:18.193
Why you exist at all.

410
00:32:18.731 --> 00:32:21.666
And when you've
found your answers,

411
00:32:22.268 --> 00:32:24.133
come back to me.

412
00:32:31.544 --> 00:32:33.205
Promise me.

413
00:32:36.116 --> 00:32:37.481
See you soon.

414
00:32:52.932 --> 00:32:54.923
That was a grown-up kiss.

415
00:32:55.368 --> 00:32:57.666
We'll do the rest
when you get back.

416
00:33:12.452 --> 00:33:15.353
If I had known
it would like end this,

417
00:33:15.455 --> 00:33:21.394
I would have changed the carpet
like Asuka suggested.

418
00:33:22.529 --> 00:33:24.588
Right, Pen Pen?

419
00:33:26.633 --> 00:33:31.195
Kaji...
I did the right thing, didn't I?

420
00:34:55.288 --> 00:34:57.882
Damn, they're persistent.

421
00:34:58.024 --> 00:35:01.152
Of course that idiot Shinji
is nowhere to be found!

422
00:35:36.296 --> 00:35:38.059
I've been waiting for you.

423
00:36:17.737 --> 00:36:18.999
I'm sorry...

424
00:36:20.473 --> 00:36:25.206
but I changed the MAGI's
programming without telling you.

425
00:36:26.245 --> 00:36:28.372
A loving daughter's final request.

426
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:31.814
Mother, let's end it together.

427
00:36:39.525 --> 00:36:41.015
It's not working
Why?!

428
00:36:41.127 --> 00:36:42.185
ACCESS DENIED

429
00:36:42.995 --> 00:36:44.223
Casper betrayed me?!

430
00:36:44.764 --> 00:36:48.825
Mother, how could you chose
your lover instead of me?

431
00:36:50.703 --> 00:36:52.364
Ritsuko Akagi.

432
00:36:53.072 --> 00:36:54.699
I truly...

433
00:37:02.048 --> 00:37:03.015
Liar.

434
00:37:12.692 --> 00:37:13.852
What's happening up there?

435
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.793
Less than a minute left
in her power reserves.

436
00:37:17.029 --> 00:37:18.587
At this rate, Asuka will...

437
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:24.627
I cannot be defeated!!

438
00:37:25.238 --> 00:37:26.865
Mama is watching after me!

439
00:37:30.276 --> 00:37:31.265
Mama?

440
00:37:32.478 --> 00:37:33.775
Mother!

441
00:37:38.918 --> 00:37:41.682
This is the last one!

442
00:38:05.545 --> 00:38:07.308
The Lance of Longinus?

443
00:38:31.103 --> 00:38:35.199
Internal power supply depleted.
Operational limit has been reached.

444
00:38:35.308 --> 00:38:37.970
Unit 02 has gone silent.

445
00:38:40.313 --> 00:38:41.541
What the...

446
00:38:42.348 --> 00:38:44.475
The defeated Eva Series...

447
00:38:59.699 --> 00:39:01.633
The Eva Series units
have reactivated!

448
00:39:09.942 --> 00:39:11.705
Are they going to finish her off?

449
00:39:25.458 --> 00:39:26.482
What's happening?!

450
00:39:26.692 --> 00:39:30.150
I don't want to see this!
I can't watch!

451
00:39:30.363 --> 00:39:32.194
Is that Unit 02?

452
00:39:46.965 --> 00:39:47.915
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

453
00:39:48.015 --> 00:39:48.915
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

454
00:39:49.015 --> 00:39:50.165
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

455
00:39:52.565 --> 00:39:53.515
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

456
00:39:53.615 --> 00:39:54.515
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

457
00:39:54.615 --> 00:39:55.515
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

458
00:39:55.615 --> 00:39:56.915
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

459
00:39:57.015 --> 00:39:58.115
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

460
00:40:03.565 --> 00:40:04.865
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

461
00:40:04.965 --> 00:40:05.915
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

462
00:40:06.045 --> 00:40:07.015
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

463
00:40:07.115 --> 00:40:08.015
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

464
00:40:08.115 --> 00:40:09.515
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

465
00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:10.515
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

466
00:40:10.615 --> 00:40:11.565
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

467
00:40:12.138 --> 00:40:13.162
Berserker!

468
00:40:13.195 --> 00:40:15.065
Stop it.

469
00:40:15.065 --> 00:40:16.065
Asuka! Stop!!

470
00:40:16.565 --> 00:40:17.315
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

471
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:18.365
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

472
00:40:18.465 --> 00:40:19.165
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

473
00:40:19.265 --> 00:40:20.265
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

474
00:40:20.365 --> 00:40:21.515
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

475
00:40:21.615 --> 00:40:22.565
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

476
00:40:22.665 --> 00:40:23.915
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

477
00:40:24.015 --> 00:40:25.115
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

478
00:40:25.215 --> 00:40:26.115
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

479
00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:27.365
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

480
00:40:27.465 --> 00:40:28.415
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

481
00:40:34.694 --> 00:40:37.288
Shinji! Unit 02!

482
00:40:37.463 --> 00:40:39.829
Asuka is... Asuka!!

483
00:40:40.032 --> 00:40:42.466
I can't get to Eva.

484
00:40:42.568 --> 00:40:44.399
There's nothing I can do.

485
00:40:56.048 --> 00:40:57.310
Mother.

486
00:41:01.253 --> 00:41:03.153
Unit 01 has finally awoken.

487
00:41:21.607 --> 00:41:23.541
Evangelion Unit 01!

488
00:41:23.643 --> 00:41:25.008
The devil himself.

489
00:41:36.822 --> 00:41:37.789
Asuka...

490
00:41:53.806 --> 00:41:56.900
To Be Continued...

491
00:46:44.863 --> 00:46:47.764
I wish to express my HEARTFELT
gratitude to the cast, staff, friends,

492
00:46:47.866 --> 00:46:50.733
and the five women who helped
bring this picture to its completion.

493
00:46:50.836 --> 00:46:52.098
Thank you very much.
Hideaki Anno

494
00:46:55.899 --> 00:46:58.993
I have already joined with Adam.

495
00:46:59.102 --> 00:47:02.071
The only way
I will ever see my Yui again,

496
00:47:02.172 --> 00:47:06.472
is through the forbidden fusion
of Adam and Lilith.

497
00:47:08.278 --> 00:47:09.836
We're running out of time.

498
00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:13.040
Your AT Field won't hold
it's shape for much longer.

499
00:47:13.884 --> 00:47:15.818
Let us begin, Rei.

500
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.585
Release your AT Field,
the barrier of your mind.

501
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:21.817
Make our imperfect souls
whole again.

502
00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:24.086
Discard this unnecessary
physical shape.

503
00:47:24.194 --> 00:47:26.526
Merge all souls into one.

504
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:30.129
And then, take me to Yui's side.

505
00:47:43.981 --> 00:47:45.380
EPISODE 26

506
00:47:45.582 --> 00:47:47.072
My Purest Heart For You

507
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.525
Asuka.

508
00:48:10.107 --> 00:48:11.074
Ikari.

509
00:48:19.516 --> 00:48:22.610
There's an object approaching
at tremendous speed from Lunar space.

510
00:48:22.719 --> 00:48:24.118
What the hell?!

511
00:48:26.423 --> 00:48:28.448
It's not...
It's the Lance of Longinus!

512
00:48:38.402 --> 00:48:41.030
At long last,
our dreams will be realized.

513
00:48:41.204 --> 00:48:44.970
The original Lance of Longinus
has been returned to us.

514
00:48:45.242 --> 00:48:48.734
We have fewer Units than we planned,
but we'll have to make do.

515
00:48:49.513 --> 00:48:52.744
Bring forth the true form
of the Eva series.

516
00:48:53.583 --> 00:48:58.384
The true form will
evangelize humanity.

517
00:48:59.089 --> 00:49:01.956
Through indiscriminate death
and through prayer,

518
00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:04.721
we will return to our original state.

519
00:49:04.828 --> 00:49:07.763
And our souls will be at peace.

520
00:49:08.165 --> 00:49:10.497
Let the sacrament begin.

521
00:49:25.048 --> 00:49:27.243
Eva Unit 01 has been captured!

522
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:30.477
Ascending to 12,000 meters!
And still rising.

523
00:49:30.854 --> 00:49:31.946
Those bastards!

524
00:49:32.055 --> 00:49:35.252
Does SEELE plan to use
Unit 01 as a medium?

525
00:49:44.368 --> 00:49:47.360
Eva Unit 01 has been marked
with the Holy Stigmata.

526
00:49:47.704 --> 00:49:50.969
Let us restore the Tree of Life!

527
00:49:51.475 --> 00:49:54.239
The Eva series have been
our faithful servants...

528
00:49:55.045 --> 00:49:57.479
and this is the reason
they were created.

529
00:50:06.323 --> 00:50:08.450
The Eva Series has unleashed
their S2 engines!

530
00:50:08.625 --> 00:50:11.355
Dimensional values are inverting.

531
00:50:11.795 --> 00:50:13.990
Numerical expression and
measurement is impossible!

532
00:50:14.631 --> 00:50:16.496
It's an Anti-AT Field.

533
00:50:21.471 --> 00:50:26.499
It's the same as
what happened 15 years ago.

534
00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.737
Has Third lmpact actually begun?

535
00:50:34.751 --> 00:50:36.480
The S2 engines have
reached critical limit.

536
00:50:36.586 --> 00:50:39.646
We're unable to maintain
gravitational control.

537
00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.150
Our mission is a failure.

538
00:50:51.134 --> 00:50:53.534
Direct hit!
Surface ground layers are melting!

539
00:50:53.637 --> 00:50:56.265
The second wave is eroding
the headquarters periphery!

540
00:50:56.506 --> 00:50:58.269
The outer hull has been exposed!

541
00:51:02.813 --> 00:51:05.111
These are only
physical shock waves!

542
00:51:05.215 --> 00:51:07.376
Set absorbers on maximum.
It should hold.

543
00:51:21.631 --> 00:51:23.963
Here to represent eternity...

544
00:51:24.067 --> 00:51:26.331
The Red Earth Purification Ceremony.

545
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:28.870
First the Geofront is returned to...

546
00:51:29.139 --> 00:51:30.902
its original form.

547
00:51:39.616 --> 00:51:43.950
The Egg of Lilith,
source of all human life.

548
00:51:44.254 --> 00:51:45.551
The Black Moon.

549
00:51:46.323 --> 00:51:50.419
We no longer wish
to return inside her shell.

550
00:51:51.194 --> 00:51:54.129
But that is for Lilith to decide.

551
00:51:55.765 --> 00:51:57.562
It appears to have begun.

552
00:51:58.335 --> 00:52:02.999
Now, Rei, it's time to reunite
me with Yui once more.

553
00:52:03.707 --> 00:52:04.674
What?!

554
00:52:05.342 --> 00:52:07.674
I am not a puppet.

555
00:52:09.646 --> 00:52:10.613
But why?

556
00:52:10.714 --> 00:52:12.978
Because I am not you.

557
00:52:15.585 --> 00:52:16.916
Rei!

558
00:52:21.825 --> 00:52:23.292
Please,

559
00:52:23.393 --> 00:52:25.020
Wait! Rei!

560
00:52:25.562 --> 00:52:28.156
I can't.
Ikari is calling me.

561
00:52:29.032 --> 00:52:30.090
Rei!

562
00:52:35.138 --> 00:52:36.105
I'm home.

563
00:52:36.465 --> 00:52:37.955
"Welcome Home '

564
00:53:26.306 --> 00:53:27.273
Rei.

565
00:53:27.374 --> 00:53:30.036
An unidentified high energy object
from Terminal Dogma...

566
00:53:30.177 --> 00:53:31.906
is approaching rapidly!

567
00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:34.775
AT Field confirmed!
Pattern Blue!

568
00:53:35.282 --> 00:53:36.408
Not an Angel?

569
00:53:36.717 --> 00:53:39.413
Negative!
It's a... a human!

570
00:53:53.545 --> 00:53:54.595
No!

571
00:53:55.545 --> 00:53:56.675
NO!

572
00:54:11.795 --> 00:54:12.645
Dammit...

573
00:54:12.645 --> 00:54:13.945
...Dammit......

574
00:54:13.945 --> 00:54:14.845
...Dammit......

575
00:54:14.845 --> 00:54:15.695
...Dammit......!

576
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:37.677
Ayanami?!

577
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.411
Rei...

578
00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:53.387
Through the destruction of
the Ego of Eva Unit 01 's pilot,

579
00:54:53.493 --> 00:54:56.189
humanity shall now be completed.

580
00:54:56.596 --> 00:54:59.690
The Third Retribution is at hand.

581
00:55:07.941 --> 00:55:10.637
The AT Fields of the Eva Series
are all resonating!

582
00:55:10.877 --> 00:55:12.367
Resonation is increasing!

583
00:55:12.779 --> 00:55:14.644
Have they begun merging with Rei?

584
00:55:37.671 --> 00:55:39.195
Psychograph signal down!

585
00:55:39.506 --> 00:55:41.565
Destrado has begun to manifest!

586
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:45.670
The pilot's ego won't be able
to take much more of this.

587
00:55:47.855 --> 00:55:49.495
No more.

588
00:55:51.495 --> 00:55:52.645
I can't take it anymore.

589
00:55:53.995 --> 00:55:54.995
I can't take it anymore.

590
00:55:55.855 --> 00:55:56.895
I can't take it anymore.

591
00:55:57.745 --> 00:55:58.745
I can't take it anymore.

592
00:55:59.645 --> 00:56:00.745
I can't take it anymore.

593
00:56:00.745 --> 00:56:02.045
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it anymore.

594
00:56:02.145 --> 00:56:03.655
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it anymore.

595
00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:05.027
Is this better?

596
00:56:07.834 --> 00:56:10.325
Have you been there
the whole time, Kaoru?

597
00:56:34.294 --> 00:56:38.196
The solenoid graph is inverting!
His ego barrier is getting weaker!

598
00:56:38.465 --> 00:56:40.558
AT Field is shifting to pattern red!

599
00:56:41.301 --> 00:56:43.428
The Fruit of Life
is held by the Angels.

600
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:46.036
The Fruit of Wisdom
is held by man.

601
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:52.579
Eva Unit 01 now posses them both,
and, therefore, becomes God.

602
00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.941
Now the Source of all souls,

603
00:56:56.049 --> 00:56:59.507
the Tree of Life
has been formed again.

604
00:56:59.619 --> 00:57:04.818
Will it be an Ark to save mankind
from the vacuum of Third impact?

605
00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:07.587
Or is it the demon
that will destroy us all?

606
00:57:08.128 --> 00:57:11.097
The fate of mankind now lies
in the hands of lkari's son.

607
00:57:11.398 --> 00:57:14.162
Tell me,
have we done the right thing?

608
00:57:14.468 --> 00:57:15.594
How should I know?!

609
00:57:19.973 --> 00:57:23.238
This Rei is your heart.

610
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:26.777
She embodies
your hopes and your dreams.

611
00:57:27.447 --> 00:57:29.176
What is it you wish for?

612
00:57:55.008 --> 00:57:56.168
I see.

613
00:57:57.444 --> 00:58:00.675
It's just like
when I first started playing the cello.

614
00:58:00.981 --> 00:58:02.380
I thought if I came here,

615
00:58:03.216 --> 00:58:05.684
I would find what I was looking for.

616
00:58:06.653 --> 00:58:08.211
Hey, Shinji! C'mon!

617
00:58:08.388 --> 00:58:11.255
Let's build a sand castle!

618
00:58:28.041 --> 00:58:29.269
Look, Mama's here!

619
00:58:29.376 --> 00:58:30.400
We gotta go now!

620
00:58:30.844 --> 00:58:32.141
Bye!

621
00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:33.676
Mama!

622
00:58:35.382 --> 00:58:36.349
Mama!

623
01:00:25.058 --> 01:00:26.650
Enough already!

624
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.588
Even just the sight of you
gets on my nerves!

625
01:00:29.896 --> 01:00:31.193
Because I'm just like you?

626
01:00:31.297 --> 01:00:32.264
Mama!

627
01:00:32.866 --> 01:00:34.197
Mama.

628
01:00:34.367 --> 01:00:35.197
Mama.

629
01:00:35.535 --> 01:00:39.301
I wasn't able to be
a mother to Shinji in the end.

630
01:00:40.774 --> 01:00:42.799
Let's do it.

631
01:00:43.376 --> 01:00:47.335
Again? I thought you were
meeting your friend at school today.

632
01:00:47.947 --> 01:00:52.350
Oh yeah, Ritsuko. Don't worry,
I've got plenty of time.

633
01:00:52.752 --> 01:00:55.915
We've been hanging
around here for the past week.

634
01:00:56.022 --> 01:00:59.185
Yeah, but I think I'm finally
starting to get the hang of it.

635
01:00:59.292 --> 01:01:01.123
C'mere.

636
01:01:05.498 --> 01:01:10.299
I guess
I just do things like that...

637
01:01:10.403 --> 01:01:12.837
to prove I exist.

638
01:01:13.239 --> 01:01:14.729
That's stupid!

639
01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:18.208
It's just two depressed grown-ups
licking each other's wounds!

640
01:01:18.311 --> 01:01:20.905
It's nice to feel needed,
even if it's just physically.

641
01:01:21.014 --> 01:01:24.177
It makes me feel wanted,
and so it makes me happy.

642
01:01:24.284 --> 01:01:26.582
It's just an easy way
to convince yourself...

643
01:01:26.686 --> 01:01:28.551
that you're worth something.

644
01:01:29.756 --> 01:01:33.123
Does Misato really
do things like that?

645
01:01:33.426 --> 01:01:36.190
Yes, this is also me.

646
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.261
The me that exists
when two hearts are joined as one.

647
01:01:40.366 --> 01:01:42.266
The me that
Shinji has never known.

648
01:01:42.368 --> 01:01:44.598
Reality can be painful,

649
01:01:44.704 --> 01:01:48.071
but it's something that
you must learn to accept.

650
01:01:48.608 --> 01:01:52.635
When I grow up, does that mean
I'll do the same things Misato does?

651
01:01:54.147 --> 01:01:56.047
You wanna kiss me?

652
01:01:56.149 --> 01:01:56.979
You can't.

653
01:01:57.083 --> 01:01:58.243
Why? Are you scared?

654
01:01:58.718 --> 01:02:00.481
That stuff's not for kids.

655
01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:02.185
Here I come!

656
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:06.181
You don't understand anything.

657
01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:07.917
You just stay away from me!

658
01:02:08.394 --> 01:02:09.486
I do understand.

659
01:02:09.796 --> 01:02:11.696
You couldn't possibly,
you big JERK!

660
01:02:12.098 --> 01:02:14.623
You really think
you can ever know me?

661
01:02:15.135 --> 01:02:17.603
You think you can even help me?!

662
01:02:18.605 --> 01:02:21.096
I can't believe
how arrogant you are!

663
01:02:21.374 --> 01:02:23.001
You will NEVER understand!!

664
01:02:24.611 --> 01:02:27.910
How can I ever understand you
if you won't say anything?

665
01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:30.842
You never talk to me, but you
expect me to understand you.

666
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:31.917
That's IMPOSSIBLE!!

667
01:02:32.485 --> 01:02:34.316
Did you ever really try, lkari?

668
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:36.188
Of course I did.

669
01:02:36.322 --> 01:02:37.653
Idiot!

670
01:02:37.757 --> 01:02:41.318
I know all about your little
jerk off fantasies about me.

671
01:02:41.427 --> 01:02:43.895
Go ahead and
do it like you always do.

672
01:02:43.997 --> 01:02:45.862
I'll even stand here
and watch you.

673
01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:51.932
If I can't have you all to myself,
then I don't want anything from you.

674
01:02:52.639 --> 01:02:54.436
Then, try being nice to me.

675
01:02:55.008 --> 01:02:56.771
We are nice to you.

676
01:02:56.876 --> 01:02:57.570
Liars!

677
01:02:58.178 --> 01:02:59.839
You're just hiding
behind those smiles,

678
01:02:59.946 --> 01:03:02.005
intentionally keeping
things ambiguous!

679
01:03:02.649 --> 01:03:05.140
Because the truth causes
everyone pain...

680
01:03:05.351 --> 01:03:07.581
because the truth is very,
very traumatic.

681
01:03:07.887 --> 01:03:10.720
But ambiguity only
causes me more pain.

682
01:03:10.824 --> 01:03:12.121
That's just an excuse.

683
01:03:12.225 --> 01:03:14.056
But it scares me,

684
01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:16.854
because I don't know if everyone
will stop wanting me again.

685
01:03:16.963 --> 01:03:20.922
I feel awkward and uneasy.
Let me hear your voice!

686
01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:22.566
Don't leave me!

687
01:03:22.869 --> 01:03:24.029
Please care about me!

688
01:03:36.382 --> 01:03:40.216
I want to help you, Asuka,
and I want to stay with you.

689
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.618
Then, don't do anything.

690
01:03:42.722 --> 01:03:44.121
Don't come near me.

691
01:03:44.824 --> 01:03:47.588
All you ever do is hurt me.

692
01:03:47.727 --> 01:03:49.319
Asuka, help me.

693
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:52.957
You're the only one
that can help me!

694
01:03:53.499 --> 01:03:54.591
Liar.

695
01:03:56.703 --> 01:03:58.967
Anyone will do.
You don't care who it is!

696
01:03:59.072 --> 01:04:00.835
You're afraid of Misato
and the First child!

697
01:04:00.974 --> 01:04:02.805
You're afraid of
your mother and father, too!

698
01:04:02.909 --> 01:04:05.139
So now you come running to me...

699
01:04:05.245 --> 01:04:07.611
because that's the easiest way
to keep from getting hurt!

700
01:04:07.714 --> 01:04:09.272
I need you to help me!

701
01:04:09.382 --> 01:04:11.646
You never even loved yourself!

702
01:04:14.053 --> 01:04:18.990
You're all you have, and
you never even learned to like yourself.

703
01:04:24.764 --> 01:04:26.356
Pathetic.

704
01:04:30.136 --> 01:04:31.535
Help me.

705
01:04:33.506 --> 01:04:39.445
Somebody please help me.

706
01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:42.373
Help me.

707
01:04:44.017 --> 01:04:45.109
Help me.

708
01:04:46.119 --> 01:04:48.314
Somebody help me!

709
01:04:48.988 --> 01:04:50.250
Don't leave me alone!

710
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.889
Don't abandon me!

711
01:04:52.292 --> 01:04:54.192
Please don't kill me!

712
01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:02.198
No.

Episode Twenty Five:
The End Of The World

739
01:05:39.505 --> 01:05:40.972
No one understands me.

740
01:05:41.207 --> 01:05:42.936
You never understood anything.

741
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:45.373
I thought this was supposed
to be a world without pain,

742
01:05:45.478 --> 01:05:46.775
and without uncertainty.

743
01:05:46.879 --> 01:05:50.508
That's because you thought that
everyone else felt the same as you do.

744
01:05:50.616 --> 01:05:53.642
You betrayed me!
You betrayed my feelings!

745
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.820
You misunderstood
from the very beginning.

746
01:05:55.922 --> 01:05:58.186
You just believed
what you wanted to believe.

747
01:05:58.291 --> 01:06:01.727
Nobody wants me,
so they can all just die.

748
01:06:01.828 --> 01:06:04.160
Then what is your hand for?

749
01:06:04.497 --> 01:06:07.261
Nobody cares whether or not I exist.

750
01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:10.163
Nothing ever changes,
so they can all just die!

751
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:13.397
Then tell me,
what is your heart for?

752
01:06:13.539 --> 01:06:15.598
It would be better
if I never existed.

753
01:06:15.742 --> 01:06:17.300
I should just die, too.

754
01:06:17.643 --> 01:06:19.543
Then why are you here?

755
01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.309
Is it okay for me to be here?

756
01:06:23.883 --> 01:06:24.872
(Silence)

757
01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:33.352
Pilot response
approaching infinite zero!

758
01:06:33.826 --> 01:06:36.852
Eva Series and Geofront
are approaching the E layer...

759
01:06:36.963 --> 01:06:38.055
and still rising!

760
01:06:42.602 --> 01:06:45.264
Current altitude is
220,000 kilometers.

761
01:06:45.371 --> 01:06:46.838
Now Entering F layer.

762
01:06:46.939 --> 01:06:48.270
All Eva units are operational!

763
01:06:48.674 --> 01:06:53.111
The Anti-AT Field from Lilith
is expanding and materializing!

764
01:07:16.436 --> 01:07:18.870
Anti-AT Field
has exceeded critical limits!

765
01:07:19.138 --> 01:07:20.105
If this continues,

766
01:07:20.206 --> 01:07:23.266
individual entities will be unable
to maintain their separate forms!

767
01:07:30.383 --> 01:07:31.782
The Chamber of Guf is open.

768
01:07:32.385 --> 01:07:35.582
The door to both the beginning
and the end of the world...

769
01:07:36.389 --> 01:07:38.448
is open at last.

770
01:07:45.231 --> 01:07:48.132
This world is
overflowing with sorrow.

771
01:07:48.568 --> 01:07:51.128
Its people are
drowning in emptiness.

772
01:07:52.004 --> 01:07:54.768
Loneliness fills their hearts.

773
01:08:07.453 --> 01:08:10.980
Ikari, did you also
finally get to see Yui again?

774
01:08:14.227 --> 01:08:18.596
The AT Fields.
The AT Fields are all disappearing.

775
01:08:18.698 --> 01:08:22.156
Is this the answer?
Is this what I was looking for?

776
01:08:25.872 --> 01:08:26.964
Ritsuko?

777
01:08:28.141 --> 01:08:29.165
Maya.

778
01:08:30.776 --> 01:08:33.370
Ritsuko. Ritsuko. Ritsuko.

779
01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:34.446
Ritsuko!!

780
01:08:36.916 --> 01:08:39.942
The beginning and the end
are one and the same.

781
01:08:40.419 --> 01:08:43.582
Yes, all is right with the world.

782
01:08:50.663 --> 01:08:54.724
I've waited so long
for this moment to arrive.

783
01:08:55.368 --> 01:08:57.996
I will finally be with you again, Yui.

784
01:08:59.138 --> 01:09:03.006
When Shinji is near me,
all I ever do is cause him pain.

785
01:09:04.143 --> 01:09:06.634
It was better
when I did nothing at all.

786
01:09:07.513 --> 01:09:09.003
Were you afraid of Shinji?

787
01:09:09.949 --> 01:09:12.747
I didn't believe
that anyone could love me.

788
01:09:13.886 --> 01:09:15.751
I don't deserve to be loved.

789
01:09:16.422 --> 01:09:18.390
So you were running away.

790
01:09:19.192 --> 01:09:22.889
You rejected the others so that
you would never be hurt.

791
01:09:23.496 --> 01:09:27.660
You were terrified by the
invisible bonds that people form.

792
01:09:27.934 --> 01:09:31.665
You were afraid,
and so you closed your heart.

793
01:09:32.705 --> 01:09:34.673
This is my retribution.

794
01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:37.901
Forgive me, Shinji.

795
01:11:18.344 --> 01:11:20.676
Ayanami Rei.

796
01:11:24.617 --> 01:11:25.584
I hate you.

797
01:11:25.685 --> 01:11:28.313
Don't call me anymore.

798
01:11:28.421 --> 01:11:30.753
You bother me.

799
01:11:30.856 --> 01:11:32.380
God, you're persistent.

800
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:33.458
Goodbye!

801
01:11:33.559 --> 01:11:37.461
I wish you'd leave.

802
01:11:37.563 --> 01:11:40.760
I have no interest in
getting back together with you.

803
01:11:40.866 --> 01:11:43.892
Let's just be friends.

804
01:11:44.003 --> 01:11:46.733
Do I even know you?

805
01:11:46.839 --> 01:11:48.807
Look at you!

806
01:11:48.908 --> 01:11:51.468
You really get on my nerves.

807
01:11:51.577 --> 01:11:54.273
Who the hell are you?

808
01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.440
I couldn't care less
whether you live or die.

809
01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:01.213
I don't love you
"that way".

810
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.550
I don't want you in my life.

811
01:12:03.656 --> 01:12:06.454
To be honest,
you get on my nerves.

812
01:12:06.559 --> 01:12:08.584
Stop following me around.

813
01:12:08.694 --> 01:12:10.992
I can't do this any more.

814
01:12:11.097 --> 01:12:13.531
Let's break up.

815
01:12:13.632 --> 01:12:15.497
I don't need you anymore.

816
01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:17.865
Who would want to go out with you?

817
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:20.734
I don't need you,
I never did.

818
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.501
Go away.

819
01:12:23.042 --> 01:12:24.009
You wimp.

820
01:12:27.546 --> 01:12:31.505
If it's too painful,
you can always make it stop.

821
01:12:32.118 --> 01:12:36.020
If you don't like it,
you can just run away.

822
01:12:37.056 --> 01:12:38.990
Do you want to be at ease?

823
01:12:39.225 --> 01:12:41.352
Do you want to feel peace of mind?

824
01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:43.991
Do you want to
become one with me?

825
01:12:44.563 --> 01:12:48.192
To have our
bodies and souls join as one?

826
01:12:48.501 --> 01:12:53.131
I'd rather die than do it with you!

827
01:13:58.103 --> 01:13:59.070
Hey...

828
01:13:59.371 --> 01:14:00.395
What is it?

829
01:14:02.808 --> 01:14:05.538
What are dreams?

830
01:14:05.845 --> 01:14:06.937
Dreams?

831
01:14:08.013 --> 01:14:10.481
Yes, dreams.

832
01:14:34.073 --> 01:14:36.633
[Does it feel good?]

833
01:14:37.643 --> 01:14:38.769
I don't understand.

834
01:14:40.112 --> 01:14:42.603
I don't understand what reality is.

835
01:14:43.382 --> 01:14:47.079
You can't bridge the gap
between your own truth...

836
01:14:47.186 --> 01:14:49.450
and the reality of others.

837
01:14:50.022 --> 01:14:53.389
I don't know
where to find happiness.

838
01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.923
So you only find happiness
in your dreams.

839
01:14:58.664 --> 01:15:02.725
Then this is not reality,
this world where no one exists.

840
01:15:02.868 --> 01:15:04.768
No, it's only a dream.

841
01:15:05.104 --> 01:15:07.698
Then I don't exist here either.

842
01:15:07.806 --> 01:15:12.436
This convenient fabrication
is your attempt to change reality.

843
01:15:12.545 --> 01:15:13.876
Is that wrong?

844
01:15:13.979 --> 01:15:17.380
You were using
fantasy to escape reality.

845
01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:20.250
Why can't I dream that I'm alone?

846
01:15:20.653 --> 01:15:22.484
That is not a dream.

847
01:15:22.821 --> 01:15:24.948
That's a substitute for reality.

848
01:15:42.775 --> 01:15:45.608
So, where is my dream?

849
01:15:45.911 --> 01:15:48.436
It is a continuation of reality.

850
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:51.779
But where is my reality?

851
01:15:53.052 --> 01:15:55.213
It is at the end of your dream.

852
01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.442
Ayanami.

853
01:16:23.849 --> 01:16:25.214
Where are we?

854
01:16:25.317 --> 01:16:28.115
This place is a sea of LCL.

855
01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.518
The primordial soup of life.

856
01:16:31.423 --> 01:16:35.519
A place with no AT Fields,
where individual forms do not exist.

857
01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:37.788
An ambiguous world...

858
01:16:37.896 --> 01:16:41.730
where you cannot tell
where you end and others begin.

859
01:16:42.368 --> 01:16:44.859
A world where
you exist everywhere...

860
01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:47.768
and yet you're nowhere,
all at once.

861
01:16:49.274 --> 01:16:50.536
Is this death?

862
01:16:51.276 --> 01:16:54.245
Not quite. This is a world
where we are all one.

863
01:16:56.048 --> 01:16:59.711
This is the world you wished for.

864
01:17:06.992 --> 01:17:10.325
But this isn't right.
This feels wrong.

865
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:13.890
If you wish for others to exist,

866
01:17:13.999 --> 01:17:17.298
the walls of their hearts
will separate them again.

867
01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:20.432
They will all feel fear once more.

868
01:17:22.174 --> 01:17:23.141
Okay then.

869
01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:33.073
Thank you.

870
01:17:38.023 --> 01:17:41.356
I only felt pain
when I existed in that reality.

871
01:17:42.561 --> 01:17:45.359
So I thought
it was alright to run away.

872
01:17:46.365 --> 01:17:50.324
But there was nothing good
in the place I escaped to either.

873
01:17:50.436 --> 01:17:56.272
Because I didn't exist there,
and so no one existed.

874
01:17:57.543 --> 01:18:01.877
Is it alright for the AT Field
to cause you and others pain again?

875
01:18:02.815 --> 01:18:03.782
I don't mind.

876
01:18:04.516 --> 01:18:07.781
But what are
the two of you within my heart?

877
01:18:08.787 --> 01:18:09.947
We are the hope...

878
01:18:10.055 --> 01:18:14.788
that people will one day
be able to understand each other.

879
01:18:14.893 --> 01:18:17.453
And we are the words,
"I love you. '

880
01:18:17.796 --> 01:18:19.696
But that's just a pretense.

881
01:18:20.332 --> 01:18:22.129
A selfish belief.

882
01:18:23.102 --> 01:18:24.865
Like some kind of prayer.

883
01:18:25.504 --> 01:18:27.233
It can't possibly last forever.

884
01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:33.077
Eventually, I'll be betrayed,
and it will abandon me.

885
01:18:34.012 --> 01:18:37.072
But still, I want to see them again,

886
01:18:37.449 --> 01:18:41.545
because at the time,
I know my feelings were real.

887
01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:50.881
Reality exists in a place unknown,
and dreams exist within reality.

888
01:19:50.989 --> 01:19:54.425
And truth lies in your heart.

889
01:19:55.294 --> 01:19:59.731
The contents of a person's heart
shapes their appearance.

890
01:20:00.766 --> 01:20:06.705
And new images will change
their hearts and their forms.

891
01:20:07.806 --> 01:20:12.334
The power of imagination is
the ability to create your own future,

892
01:20:12.578 --> 01:20:15.741
and the power to create
your own flow of time.

893
01:20:17.015 --> 01:20:20.678
But if people don't act
of their own free will,

894
01:20:20.886 --> 01:20:22.717
then nothing will change at all.

895
01:20:22.821 --> 01:20:27.656
So, you must regain your own
lost form by your own volition.

896
01:20:27.759 --> 01:20:30.694
Even if it means
your words become lost...

897
01:20:30.829 --> 01:20:33.764
or confused with
the words of others.

898
01:20:56.321 --> 01:20:58.380
Anyone can return to human form...

899
01:20:58.490 --> 01:21:03.553
as long as they are able to imagine
themselves within their own heart.

900
01:21:09.501 --> 01:21:10.991
Don't worry.

901
01:21:11.803 --> 01:21:16.263
All living creatures have the power
to be brought back to life...

902
01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:18.866
and the will to go on living.

903
01:21:19.711 --> 01:21:24.478
Anywhere can be paradise,
as long as you have the will to live.

904
01:21:24.716 --> 01:21:27.310
After all, you are alive,

905
01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:34.355
so you will always have
the chance to be happy.

906
01:21:45.237 --> 01:21:48.570
As long as the Sun,
the Moon, and the Earth exist,

907
01:21:51.009 --> 01:21:53.000
everything will be alright.

908
01:22:17.069 --> 01:22:18.593
Will you be alright?

909
01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:25.738
I still don't know
where my happiness lies.

910
01:22:26.445 --> 01:22:29.642
I'll still think about
why I'm here,

911
01:22:29.748 --> 01:22:33.844
and whether or not
it was good to come back.

912
01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.256
But that's just
stating the obvious over and over.

913
01:22:39.858 --> 01:22:41.883
I am myself.

914
01:22:45.664 --> 01:22:47.029
But, Mother...

915
01:22:48.934 --> 01:22:51.027
What will you do, Mother?

916
01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.765
When man created Evangelion,

917
01:22:57.876 --> 01:23:01.607
were we trying
to create a clone of God?

918
01:23:01.713 --> 01:23:05.274
Yes. Humans can
only exist on this earth,

919
01:23:05.884 --> 01:23:08.819
but the Evangelion
can live forever...

920
01:23:09.121 --> 01:23:12.284
along with the human soul
that dwells within.

921
01:23:13.225 --> 01:23:15.420
Even 5 billion years from now,

922
01:23:15.527 --> 01:23:20.726
when the Earth, the Moon,
and the Sun are gone,

923
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:23.895
Eva will exist.

924
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:26.398
It will be lonely,

925
01:23:26.505 --> 01:23:28.735
but as long as
one person still lives.

926
01:23:28.907 --> 01:23:32.843
It will be eternal proof
that mankind ever existed.

927
01:23:34.679 --> 01:23:37.113
Goodbye, Mother.

928
01:26:42.267 --> 01:26:43.996
How disgusting.

929
01:26:44.135 --> 01:26:47.901
